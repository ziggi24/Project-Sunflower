  "description": "This is a mood tracker app, with daily checkins and a profile page with more info about your moods. On your profile page some of the information you add in each of your checkins get incorporated into your personal flower. If you have several days in a row where you are in a good, happy mood your flower might slowly change to a brighter yellow or pink color. If you're having a few rough days in a row then your flower could slowly change colors to darker blues and purples. Each entry you add will also add to the height of the flower, and each entry will show up as a leaf on the side of the flower, making almost a timeline. Each flower will have a hover state with some brief info about that mood entry, and if you click on it, it will take you to the full entry.",
